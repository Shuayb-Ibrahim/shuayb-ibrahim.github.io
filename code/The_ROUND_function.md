The `ROUND()` rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places. It is usually applied to the single values that aggregate functions return.

<u>The syntax for the round function in [[The SELECT statement]] is:</u>

```sql
SELECT ROUND(function, decimal_places)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
