SQL's syntax comprises several types of statements that allow you to perform various commands and operations.

The main components are:
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- Data Control Language (DCL)
- Transaction Control Language (TCL)

### Data Definition Language
The statements part of the Data Definition Language syntax are:
- [The CREATE statement](/code/The_CREATE_statement)
- [The ALTER statement](/code/The_ALTER_statement)
- [The DROP statement](/code/The_DROP_statement)
- [The RENAME statement](/code/The_RENAME_statement)
