# The CHECK constraint
The `Check` constraint is used to specify a predicate that every tuple must satisfy in a given relation. It limits the values that a column can hold in a relation.

-   The predicate in check constraint can hold a sub query.
-   Check constraint defined on an attribute restricts the range of values for that attribute.
-   If the value being added to an attribute of a tuple violates the check constraint, the check constraint evaluates to false and the corresponding update is aborted.
-   Check constraint is generally specified with the CREATE TABLE command in SQL.

<u>The syntax for the Check constraint:</u>
```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column_name data_type,
...
CHECK(column_name IN (option_a, option_b, option_c))
);
```

The check constraint in the above SQL command restricts the `column_name` to belong to only the categories specified. If a new tuple is added or an existing tuple in the relation is updated with an entry that doesnâ€™t belong to any of the three options mentioned, then the corresponding database update is aborted.
