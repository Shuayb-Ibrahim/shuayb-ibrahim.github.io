### Who am I?
<hr>
My name is Shuayb Ibrahim and I'm currently working as a Business Intelligence Analyst for Maginhawa Group, a small to medium size company in the hospitality sector. 

### Education
<hr>
I plan on attending university to complete a BSc in Data Science and Business Analytics in the coming academic year starting in August 2022. My highest level of education is A Level where I completed A Levels in Computer Science, Mathematics and Spanish. I am also a certified entry-level python programmer.

### My hobbies
<hr>
In my free time, I watch an unhealthy amount of sports so I started writing the Perspective: Analytical newsletter, covering european club football, NBA basketball and NFL football with a focus on the analytical side of the different sports. I complete data science related courses on Udemy and Coursera to expand and refine my skillset. I use my new found skills to create projects solving data analytics case studies. I post and share useful code snippets with explanations to help fellow self taught analysts.
