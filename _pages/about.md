### Who am I?

My name is Shuayb Ibrahim. I'm currently working as a Business Intelligence Analyst for Maginhawa Group, a small to medium size company in the hospitality sector and I am a Data Science Student at the University of London.

### Education
<hr>I am an undergraduate student at the University of London, undertaking the Data Science and Business Analytics course with academic direction being provided by London School of Economics and Political Science. I completed A Levels in Computer Science, Mathematics and Spanish. I am also a certified entry-level python programmer.

### My hobbies
<hr>
In my free time, I enjoy writing data journalistic articles inspired by the work by FiveThirtyEight where I cover european club football, NBA basketball and NFL football with a focus on the analytical side of the different sports. I complete data science related courses on Udemy and Coursera to expand and refine my skillset. I use my new found skills to create projects solving data analytics case studies. I post and share useful code snippets with explanations to help fellow self taught analysts.
