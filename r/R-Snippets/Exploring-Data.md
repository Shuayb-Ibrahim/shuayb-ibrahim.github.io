There are three common functions that are really good for exploring data:
- The head() function which lets you look at the first few rows of the data-set
 ```r
 head(dataset_name)
 ```
 - The tail() function which lets you look at the last few rows of the data-set
 ```r
 tail(dataset_name)
 ```
- The names() function which lets you look at the names of the columns of the data-set
 ```r
 names(dataset_name)
 ```
- The View() function which allows you to view the entire data-set in a separate window
 ```r
 View(dataset_name)
 ```
