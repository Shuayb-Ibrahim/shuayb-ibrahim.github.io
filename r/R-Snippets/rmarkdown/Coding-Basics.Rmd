```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Coding Basics

**Mathematical calculations:**

```{r}
1/200 * 30
(342+34+4)/5
cos(2/sqrt(2))
```

**Creating new objects:**

```{r}
x <- 1 + 1
```

All R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form (use snake_case when naming objects):

```{r}
object_name <- value
```

## Calling Functions

Built-in functions in R are called like this:

```{r}
function_name(arg1= val1, arg2 = val1, ...)
```

For example, if we want to call upon the seq() function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10:

```{r}
seq(1,10)
```
