## Exploring Data

There are three common functions that are really good for exploring data:

-   The head() function which lets you look at the first few rows of the data-set

    ```{r}
    head(dataset_name)
    ```

-   The names() function which lets you look at the names of the columns of the data-set

    ```{r}
    names(dataset_name)
    ```

-   The View() function which allows you to view the entire data-set in a separate window

    ```{r}
    View(dataset_name)
    ```
