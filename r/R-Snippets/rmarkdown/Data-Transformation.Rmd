## Introduction to dplyr

The dplyr package is all you need for data preprocessing and we will be going through the syntax, uses and applications of its most common functions.

### Prerequisites

The library package we need to download is tidyverse as dpylr is a core member of the tidyverse. We shall also download the nycflights dataset to use an example dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```

### View Dataset

The two functions to use if you want to view a dataset are: 

- The glimpse function (printed table with Row and Columns info)
```{r}
glimpse(flights)
```

-   The View function (interactive table pops up on RStudio)
```{r}
View(flights)
```
